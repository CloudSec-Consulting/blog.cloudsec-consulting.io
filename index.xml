      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Khaled, just a regular person with a love for technology, especially cybersecurity and cloud computing. I started this blog to share my knowledge and experiences in the tech world, and I hope to learn from others along the way.
With some years of experience, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects, but I&amp;rsquo;m always humbled by how much there is still to learn. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m here, to share what I know and learn from others in this amazing community.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m getting started with Azure. After a couple of years playing with GCP and Azure, I thought it&amp;rsquo;s time to play with Azure. I hope I can reach a good depth and be able to compare the 3 cloud providers in future posts! I don&amp;rsquo;t promise anything but I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best :)
What the heck is Azure RBAC ? RBAC stands for Role-Based Access Control. In short it&amp;rsquo;s used to manage access to ressources.</description>
